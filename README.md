This dataset contains 18278 instances and 104 attributes. 
This project will enable team managers, coaches, and players to 
understand their own game better, their mistakes, their opponent’s 
strategies, weaknesses, game strategies, etc. Football is the most 
popular sport ranked by total fans in the world and what can we 
do to improve the growth? This project therefore seeks to answer 
the following questions: 
1. What metrics can best forecast the future potential of young 
athletes? 
2. How can a team’s playing strategy be optimized based on 
the analysis of player performance data? 
3. How does a player’s performance change throughout a sea- 
son or their career? 
Thus, the goal is not just to decode FIFA 20 but also to enrich the 
whole field of sports analytics, promoting a deeper understanding, 
smarter decision-making, and richer fan experience.
